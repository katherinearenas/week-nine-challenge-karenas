    ##Installation
    First we make sure our system has node.js installed. Then we run`npm i`

     ##Contributions
    By forking the gitHub repo fellow developers have the option to add their own prompts and generate their own README files.

     ##Tests
    Try it!  As we  enter responses we are  adding the content for our README to our generate markdown function which generates the content for the test README.
